# Definition

Equation: Numbers and symbols that, when taken as a whole, equate to a specific value. An equation always contains an equals sign so that you know that the numbers and symbols represent the specific value on the other side of the equals sign. Equations generally contain variable information presented as a symbol, but they’re not required to use variables.

Formula: A combination of numbers and symbols used to express information or ideas. Formulas normally present mathematical or logical concepts, such as defining the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers (the video at <https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-sixth-grade-math/> cc-6th-factors-and-multiples/cc-6th-gcf/v/greatest-common- divisor tells how this works). Generally, they show the relationship between two or more variables.

Algorithm: A sequence of steps used to solve a problem. The sequence presents a unique method of addressing an issue by providing a particular solution. An algorithm need not represent mathematical or logical concepts, even though the presentations in this book often do fall into those categories because people most commonly use algorithms in this manner. In order for a process to represent an algorithm, it must be:

    • Finite: The algorithm must eventually solve the problem. This book discusses problems with a known solution so that you can evaluate whether an algorithm solves the problem correctly.
    
    • Well-defined: The series of steps must be precise and present steps that are understandable. Especially because computers are involved in algorithm use, the computer must be able to understand the steps to create a usable algorithm.
    
    • Effective: An algorithm must solve all cases of the problem for which someone defined it. An algorithm should always solve the problem it has to solve. Even though you should anticipate some failures, the incidence of failure is rare and occurs only in situations that are acceptable for the intended algorithm use.
